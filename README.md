# Portfolio Website

A portfolio site is an extension of a freelancer’s (or company’s) résumé. It provides a convenient way for potential clients to view your work while also allowing you to expand on your skills and services. This, however, isn’t the ultimate purpose of a portfolio website.

The ultimate purpose of a portfolio website is to provide a way for you to land more clients, whether that means freelance work, more clients for your agency or employment at a company. You should decide what you want to accomplish with your website before adding content to it.
